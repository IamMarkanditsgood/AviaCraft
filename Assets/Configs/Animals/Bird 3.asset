  Name: Max. I'm Not Just a Kid Anymore
  Description: "I\u2019m 14. When it all started, I was 11. I don\u2019t remember
    much of the world before \u2014 just fragments: a seagull\u2019s cry, ice cream
    for breakfast when Dad let me, and Mom kissing the top of my head, even when
    she was mad. Then everything disappeared. Mom\u2026 vanished. Dad led me through
    different shelters. He used to say, \u201CYou\u2019re a real pilot, Max. You
    don\u2019t crash.\u201D I held on to that. Even when he\u2026 stayed behind and
    I went on. Alone. Since then, I acted like a grown-up. I cooked, hunted rats,
    hid, helped others. When I first saw the airplane \u2014 real, red, just like
    the one from a childhood poster \u2014 I didn\u2019t believe it. I thought it
    was a mirage. But it landed. And they called me inside. I didn\u2019t want to
    cry. But I did. Now I\u2019m sitting here, holding a torn piece of that old poster
    in my hand. Thinking of Dad.  He would\u2019ve been proud.  Thank you\u2026 for
    letting me be a kid again. If only for a moment. "
