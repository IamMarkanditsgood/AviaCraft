  Name: Maria. Before and After the Light
  Description: "I used to work as a librarian. A small neighborhood library, the
    smell of old pages, a clock ticking in the silence \u2014 that was my whole world.
    People rarely visited, but I knew every face that still loved to read. Especially
    a boy named Leon. Every time he came in, he borrowed books about airplanes. I
    used to joke that one day he\u2019d fly away from us \u2014 and who would\u2019ve
    thought how right that joke would turn out to be. When it all began, first came
    the noise. Then \u2014 silence. People disappeared, and I was left locked inside
    the library. Funny how the walls that once protected the books suddenly became
    my fortress. I stayed hidden there for months, living off vending machine snacks,
    collecting rainwater, and reading aloud so I wouldn\u2019t forget what a voice
    sounds like. Then they came \u2014 not the infected. The ones who still breathed.
    A group of three teenagers. One of them was Leon. He hadn\u2019t forgotten. He
    came back. We wandered together, hiding, surviving, always searching, until we
    heard rumors about you. About someone who could fly people to safety. That was
    our last chance. When I heard the roar of the engine, my heart raced like it
    hadn\u2019t in years. A plane. A real plane. And I was in it. There was light
    in the sky again. No novel I ever read could compare to that feeling. Thank you.
    You didn\u2019t just save me. You saved my memories, my faith \u2014 and maybe
    even my voice. "
