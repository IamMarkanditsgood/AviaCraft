  Name: Denis. I Chose to Walk
  Description: "My wife and I lived on the edge of the city. A small house, a garden,
    a wooden fence. When it all began, we didn\u2019t understand the scale. Then
    it became clear \u2014 this wasn\u2019t temporary. This was the end of the world
    we knew. We held on for a long time. Together. She cooked, I fixed the roof,
    caught rainwater, reinforced the fences. We didn\u2019t speak of fear \u2014
    we just did what we could. One day, she got sick. Not the infection. Just weakness.
    A cold. No medicine. I stayed. Until the end. I buried her in the garden. Quietly.
    No words. No cross. Just a stone. I stayed one more week. Then I realized \u2014
    if I stayed longer, it would be over for me too. And she wouldn\u2019t have wanted
    that. She always said, \u201CLive while you can. Even if it hurts.\u201D I found
    your camp by accident. Or maybe not. Maybe she led me. Now I\u2019m on this plane,
    looking down. And I think: I didn\u2019t betray her memory. I carried it with
    me. Thank you\u2026 for giving me a place to begin again. "
