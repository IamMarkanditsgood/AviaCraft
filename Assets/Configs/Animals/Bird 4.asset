  Name: Elena. Flowers from the Past
  Description: "When I was little, my grandmother taught me to plant flowers. She
    said even a single sprout can bring life to a place. Back then, I didn\u2019t
    really get it. The world already seemed alive to me. And then\u2026 it died.
    For many years, I just walked. Through cities, through camps, through silence.
    I\u2019m not a hero. I didn\u2019t save anyone. But in my backpack, I always
    carried a small pouch of seeds. I planted them wherever I could \u2014 near burned
    houses, in cracks in the pavement, at abandoned stations. Not for food. For memory.
    People often looked at me strangely. Some laughed. But once, I returned to a
    place where I\u2019d planted just a few seeds. And daisies were blooming there.
    Yellow like the sun. And someone had left a jar of water beside them. Now I\u2019m
    on a plane. The sky outside is still gray, but in my lap is the same pouch. And
    you know what? I think I\u2019ll plant something again. Because if there\u2019s
    still ground where something can grow \u2014 there\u2019s still a world worth
    saving. Thank you\u2026 for giving me the chance to plant hope somewhere new. "
