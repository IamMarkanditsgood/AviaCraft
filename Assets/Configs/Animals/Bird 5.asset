  Name: Omar. I Just Wanted Silence
  Description: "I\u2019ve always been a watchmaker. My workshop smelled of oil, glass,
    and patience. People didn\u2019t just bring me watches \u2014 they brought time
    they wanted restored. I loved repairing them. But more than anything, I loved
    listening to the ticking \u2014 quiet, steady. It was my way of bringing order
    to chaos. When the first waves of the infected came, I stayed in my workshop.
    Closed the shutters. Kept repairing. I thought: if the mechanism keeps ticking,
    the world must still be okay. But over time, the clocks stopped. Gears rusted.
    People never came back. For a long time, I lived among broken clocks. Dozens
    of them. All ticking out of sync. Sometimes I wound them just to hear sound \u2014
    to remember rhythm. Sometimes, I thought they were talking to me. When I was
    found, I didn\u2019t know what to feel. I didn\u2019t believe there was anywhere
    left to fly. But as I sat in that plane, I heard the steady hum of the engine.
    It sounded like a giant timepiece. And I realized \u2014 order is still possible.
    Thank you\u2026 for giving me rhythm again. "
