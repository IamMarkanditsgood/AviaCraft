  Name: "Nika. I Don\u2019t Hide Anymore"
  Description: "My name is Nika. Before the apocalypse, I was a teacher. I taught
    high school biology. For years, I believed I was helping kids understand how
    the world works. The irony is \u2014 the world turned out much crueler than any
    textbook. When it all went wrong, I hid. First in my home. Then in the school
    basement. I locked the door and pretended the walls would protect me. But the
    truth? I was scared. Not just of the dead. I was scared of losing myself. Then
    I found a notebook. Someone's \u2014 left behind in class. Inside were doodles,
    notes, scribbles. One page was a dream: a girl who wanted to become a pilot.
    I don\u2019t know if any of my students made it, but from that day on, I started
    writing every day. Not to survive \u2014 but to remember who I am. When your
    scouts found me, I was still clutching that notebook. Now it\u2019s with me on
    this plane. And I know \u2014 I\u2019m not hiding anymore. I\u2019m flying forward,
    to where teaching still matters. Where belief still matters. Thank you for giving
    me wings. Even if they weren\u2019t mine. "
