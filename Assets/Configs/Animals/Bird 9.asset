  Name: Sonya. I Never Asked What I Wanted
  Description: "I was always needed. At home \u2014 younger brothers. At work \u2014
    I was a medic. In the camp \u2014 I became the one everyone went to. People got
    used to the idea that Sonya could handle it. Sonya knew what to do. Sonya didn\u2019t
    get tired. And honestly, I never complained. Until something inside me grew quiet.
    I started to forget what I liked. That I used to play piano. That I once dreamed
    of seeing the ocean. That I was afraid of the dark, but learned to be brave \u2014
    for others. I became so \u201Cfor someone else,\u201D I forgot who I was. When
    the evacuation offer came, I said no at first. \u201CThere are others. I\u2019ll
    wait. I\u2019m useful here.\u201D But a woman I had helped took my hand and said,
    \u201CNow you\u2019re needed there.\u201D It wasn\u2019t heroism. It was permission.
    To breathe. Now I\u2019m on the plane. And I don\u2019t know what comes next.
    But for the first time, I feel like I\u2019m not running from. I\u2019m flying
    toward. And that\u2019s also a kind of salvation. Thank you\u2026 for saving
    room for people like me. "
