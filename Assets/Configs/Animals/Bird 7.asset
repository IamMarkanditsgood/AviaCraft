  Name: Sabrina. I Remembered Their Voices
  Description: "My name is Sabrina. I used to work as an emergency dispatcher. All
    I did was answer. \u201C911, what\u2019s your emergency?\u201D At first, you
    say it calmly. Later, almost on autopilot. But deep down, you still remember
    the voices. When the world began to collapse, the calls didn\u2019t stop immediately.
    Even after the central lines went down, some signals still came through. I answered
    in silence, while the world screamed in chaos around me. One boy \u2014 he called
    every night. He said, \u201CI just want someone to talk to so it\u2019s not so
    scary.\u201D I didn\u2019t know where he was, or if he survived. But I answered.
    Every night. Until the line went silent forever. Later, I wrote things down.
    Not names \u2014 stories. I still carry a notebook full of sentences, fragments,
    voices. When I reached your people, I was still holding it. Someone asked, \u201CWhy
    carry junk?\u201D But it\u2019s not junk. It\u2019s memory. It\u2019s them. Thank
    you\u2026 for giving me a chance to carry their voices forward. Even if they\u2019re
    gone. "
