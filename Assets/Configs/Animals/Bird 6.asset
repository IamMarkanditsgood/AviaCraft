  Name: "Tal. Trust Doesn\u2019t Come Easy"
  Description: "I don\u2019t like talking about myself. The years after the collapse
    taught me that silence is safer. The less people know about you, the harder it
    is to be betrayed, found, used. I survived by being invisible. Not kind. Not
    brave. Just careful. I wandered the ruins alone. I didn\u2019t help anyone and
    didn\u2019t get in anyone\u2019s way. Sometimes I found food \u2014 I\u2019d
    leave a bit behind for those who came after. No words, no thanks. That was my
    way of staying human without opening up. When I heard about you, I didn\u2019t
    believe it. Someone was building planes? Flying people out? It sounded too good
    to be real. But something inside shifted. Maybe I was just tired of being alone.
    Now I\u2019m on this plane. People around me are smiling. Someone offered me
    an apple. I didn\u2019t take it \u2014 not yet. But I remember it. Thank you\u2026
    for not asking questions. For just letting me board. "
