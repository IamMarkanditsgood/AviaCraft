  Name: Isaac. I Held on to Music
  Description: "Before the end of the world, I was a street musician. Played guitar
    in subway stations, sometimes in parks. People tossed coins, sometimes a smile.
    Sometimes that was enough to feel seen. I called it \"paying for presence.\"
    When everything collapsed, I was stuck in one of the stations. People were running,
    hiding, screaming. Me\u2026 I kept playing. Maybe it was fear. Or maybe resistance.
    Deep down, I didn\u2019t want to vanish quietly. As long as I played \u2014 I
    was alive. Then the strings ran out. My fingers cracked, the strings snapped,
    the sound stopped. I found another guitar elsewhere \u2014 old, beat-up, but
    with a whole soul. With it, I walked through shattered streets, sewers, rooftops,
    and every night \u2014 I played. Sometimes just for myself. Sometimes for someone
    who hadn\u2019t given up yet. When your people found me, I didn\u2019t believe
    it at first. And when I took off in that plane and heard someone laugh for the
    first time in ages \u2014 I knew: the music wasn\u2019t for nothing. My songs
    didn\u2019t save the world. But they saved me. And you \u2014 you saved what
    was left. "
